# Header Check

Add clickable checkboxes next to Markdown headings in Obsidian.  
Perfect for exam questions, reading lists, or any document where you want to mark headings as “done” without changing the note content.

## Features

- Checkbox appears to the left of each heading.
- Click to toggle a heading as done (state is stored per file + line).
- Empty checkboxes are only visible on hover; checked ones are always visible.
- Works in Reading / Preview mode and for embedded notes.
- Doesn't modify your Markdown (no extra `#done` tags in the file).
- Settings:
  - `Include` paths – limit the plugin to specific folders/files, empty field will include everything.
  - `Exclude` paths – never show checkboxes in these folders/files.
